    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather
    than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in
    a pair of bespoke brogues.</p>

    <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
    software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
    corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
    which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
    identity.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
    web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define
    the web of this period.</p>

    <p>In her essay, <em>A Vernacular Web</em> (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:
    bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
    ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="trace">
    <h2>The trAce Community</h2>
    <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
    relationship. This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at
    Nottingham Trent University in 1995...</p>

    <p>The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
    about the use of mixed media in writing...</p>
  </section>

  <section id="media">
    <h2>Media Archaeology</h2>
    <p>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
    Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated... it is not a historical object anymore but actively
    generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in
    modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox...</p>
  </section>

  <section id="revival">
    <h2>Revival & DIY Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding The Great Web 1.0
    Revival. Its author Kyle Chayka observed... "We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where
    everything was smaller..."</p>

    <p>The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social
    network TILDE.CLUB, which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer...</p>
  </section>

  <section id="labour">
    <h2>Manual Labour & The Body</h2>
    <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
    involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a
    'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions...</p>

    <p>Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock's <em>The One Mile
    Scroll</em> (2008)... Through the labour of the body the virtual space of the browser window is transformed into an actual,
    physical distance.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="resistance">
    <h2>Slowness and Resistance</h2>
    <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of
    resistance. In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications,
    read-only devices, search algorithms... it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish
    experimental web art and writing projects.</p>

    <p>The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I
    am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways.</p>
